# SWIRE Delivery Standardization 
## MSBA Capstone
## Team 2 - Imogen Holdsworth & Madalyn Young


### Business Problem
Swire does not have a systematic way to identify which customers are expected to be well performing in the future and therefore does not have a clear strategy for which customers they choose to service internally on red truck versus an alternate route to market.
The purpose of the project is to identify customers that Swire currently works with that are or will be ordering above/below the threshold set at 400 gallons a year. The project will include developing a model to predict which customers are anticipated to grow above threshold and include analysis on characteristics of profitable red truck customers.

### Group Solution

Our group determined the best model for SWIRE are two multi level model's segmented by retailer/non-retailer customers and using a customer segementation method based on growth and orders as a random effect. 


### Business Value of Solution
The business value derived from the solution is that SWIRE will be able to identify customers that are expected to grow to order above the 400 gallon threshold and contribute to SWIRE's overall revenue and profitability in a meaningful way. 

### Challenges we faced
The largest challenge in this project is that the dataset only contains two years of data, so we were required to use 2024 growth rate to predict 2024. We also could not see true long term ordering trends, which are the largest predictor for understanding a customers future growth
